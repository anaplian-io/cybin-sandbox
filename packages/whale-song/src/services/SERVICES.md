All game logic should be abstracted as much as possible from rendering and exist in this directory or its
subdirectories. Files should be sort, explicit, and follow SOLID design principles. They must also be object-oriented
classes. All dependencies should be injected through the constructors as props.
No dependencies should be optional unless truly necessary.
